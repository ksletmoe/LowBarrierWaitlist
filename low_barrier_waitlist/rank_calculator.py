    Calculate a participant's rank. A higher number is higher ranked (top of the list).
    (i.e., Reverse this when sorting.)

    Change this function to change the ranking algorithm.
    
    The code in the comments below is a ranking system based on mortality vulerability, as described in several research papers namely:
    http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073979
    http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073979
    
    This code cannot currently be used to to a JOHS agreement regarding this ranking system but should be argued for in the future as it
    has a scientific basis.
